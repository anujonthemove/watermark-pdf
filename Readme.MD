# How to create watermarks in LibreOffice Writer?

To create a watermark in LibreOffice Writer, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open Your Document
- Launch LibreOffice Writer and open the document to which you want to add a watermark. Watermarks can only be added in Writer, not in other LibreOffice applications like Calc.

## Step 2: Access the Watermark Feature
- Click on **Format** in the menu bar.
- Select **Watermark** from the dropdown menu. This will open the Watermark dialog box.

## Step 3: Configure Your Watermark
- In the Watermark dialog, enter the text you want to use as your watermark (e.g., "DRAFT", "CONFIDENTIAL").
- **Font and Color**: Choose a suitable font and color for your watermark. It's recommended to use simple fonts for better legibility.
- **Angle**: Set the angle of the watermark. The default angle is 45 degrees, which is typically suitable for most documents.
- **Transparency**: Adjust the transparency level. A transparency of around 75% is often effective, making it visible without being distracting.

## Step 4: Apply the Watermark
- Once you have configured all settings, click **OK** to apply the watermark. You should see it appear on all pages of your document.

## Step 5: Removing or Modifying the Watermark
- If you need to remove or change the watermark later, simply go back to **Format > Watermark**, modify or delete the text, and click **OK** again.

### Additional Option: Adding an Image as a Watermark
If you prefer to use an image instead of text:
1. Go to **Format > Page**.
2. In the **Area** tab, find the Bitmap section and click on **Add/Import** to select your image.
3. Adjust its position and transparency as needed, then click **OK**.

This method allows you to effectively brand your documents or indicate their status while maintaining readability.
